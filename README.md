A creative coding project I started to experiment with generative art and animation with code. It is heavily inspired by [Motus Art](https://owenmcateer.github.io/Motus-Art/) and Daniel Shiffman who produces excellent coding resources over at [TheCodingTrain](https://thecodingtrain.com/).

The website for this project was created using the [Phantom](https://html5up.net/phantom) template from HTML5 UP.
